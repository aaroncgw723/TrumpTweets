For our baseline model, we were inspired by this paper (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) 
to use a latent Dirichlet Allocation (LAD) model in conjunction with topic modeling. 
Additionally, this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04907.pdf) outlines our model that uses word embedding instead of the LAD model. 
We also use sentiment analysis with the topic modeling, which is described here 
(http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~huynv/research/aspect-sentiment/Joint%20sentiment%20topic%20model%20for%20sentiment%20analysis.pdf).

Similar projects have been done previously, namely, using Twitter text data to predict stock prices. This study (http://first.ijs.si/FirstShowcase/Content/pub/HCI-KDD-2013.pdf)
used sentiment analysis with SVM classification to categorize tweets into positive, negative, and neutral, and tried to determine whether
the mood of tweets about a specific company impacts its stock price. Here (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09225.pdf) is another related study,
which also used sentiment analysis and word2vec embeddings to see whether public opinion of a company affects its stock.
This one (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3003.pdf) takes a more general approach. Rather than focus on specific tweets, they collected random
ones to find out whether general overall mood affects the Dow Jones Industrial Average over time. Their primary models used the package OpinionFinder,
which is a sentiment analysis tool to classify text as positive or negative, and an expansion that they created called GPOMS
which classifies into six mood possibilities instead of two.
