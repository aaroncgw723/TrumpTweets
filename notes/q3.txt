For our baseline model, we were inspired by this paper (http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) 
to use a latent Dirichlet Allocation (LAD) model in conjunction with topic modeling. 
Additionally, this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.04907.pdf) outlines our model that uses word embedding instead of the LAD model. 
We also use sentiment analysis with the topic modeling, which is described here 
(http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~huynv/research/aspect-sentiment/Joint%20sentiment%20topic%20model%20for%20sentiment%20analysis.pdf).

Similar projects have been done previously, namely, using Twitter text data to predict stock prices. This study (http://first.ijs.si/FirstShowcase/Content/pub/HCI-KDD-2013.pdf)
used sentiment analysis with SVM classification to categorize tweets into positive, negative, and neutral, and tried to determine whether
the mood of tweets about a specific company impacts its stock price. Here (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09225.pdf) is another related study,
which also used sentiment analysis and word2vec embeddings to see whether public opinion of a company affects its stock.
This one (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.3003.pdf) takes a more general approach. Rather than focus on specific tweets, they collected random
ones to find out whether general overall mood affects the Dow Jones Industrial Average over time. Their primary models used the package OpinionFinder, which is a sentiment analysis tool to classify text as positive or negative, and an expansion that they created called GPOMS which classifies into six mood possibilities instead of two.

Stocks:

Our notion of stocks as log-normally distributed came from Stephen Blyth's book "An Introduction to Quantitative Finance" where he shows how the Black Sholes equation can be solved by assuming a log-normal distribution for the binomial tree as step size shrinks to zero. This was an especially attractive solution because the log-normal distribution has a strictly positive support.

Blyth, Stephen. An Introduction to Quantitative Finance. Oxford University Press, 2014.

To justify the linear combinations of stocks we also relied heavily on material present in Joe Blizstein's indroduction to probability book: Blitzstein, Joseph K., and Jessica Hwang. Introduction to Probability. CRC Press.

Our decision to model moving averages was obtained elsewhere, but confirmed by the following paper:

Raudys, Aistis et al. “Moving Averages for Financial Data Smoothing.” ICIST (2013).

A resource that we would like to further investigate for analyzing stock prices is the following: resource which is extremely informative about how to apply autoregression techniques in python:
