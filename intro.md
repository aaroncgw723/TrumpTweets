On August 22nd 2019, China anounced retaliatory tariffs against the United States. Then at 9:59 the President tweeted saying in part "Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately looking for an alternative to China". According to CNBC, shortly thereafter "the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 435 points, or 1.6%, while the S&P 500 slid 1.7% and the Nasdaq Composite dove 2%."

Earlier in the year, on June 18th 2019, Trump tweeted "Had a very good telephone conversation with President Xi of China. We will be having an extended meeting next week at the G-20 in Japan" and the stock market shortly thereafter "the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA,  1.4% the S&P 500 index (SPX) climbed 1.3%, while the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP advanced 1.8%.

Indisputably the President's online words, have the power to affect markets. But to what degree do his words actually affect gold prices stocks and bonds? Which words are most associated with the markets' rise and fall?

In this project, we seek to understand how the President's tweets might affect these various markets. Specifically we attempted to train nueral nets on sentiment analysis associated tweet keywords to predict log-adjusted stock prices, bond prices, and commodity prices. 

Our ability to design models to address this problem difficult problem is chalenging because Trump's tweets tend to affect the market instantaneously, while we only have access to inter-day prices. 

The markets, as mass activity of billions of people, millions of companies and trillions of dollars are a nigh on impossibly complex system to imagine. It is impossible that one man's tweets can alone change the tradjectory of markets, so we were actually impressed by the limited successof our method. More importantly, as our work came together over the final week, many powerful and interesting extensions revealed themselves which was exciting and indicative of time well spent.
